Ventis is a bottom-up control plane and agent serving framework that enables developers to build, deploy and control agentic workflow serving with ease. Ventis derives it's name from the latin word 'ventus' meaning wind. True to its name, Ventis is like the wind, invisible but always present. 

## Core Features
- **Easy development and deployment**: Developers write agents in python as if writing single node local code. Ventis takes care of deployment, management and orchestration of agents and workflows. Deployment engineers running this workflow can specify authorization and other serving policies, Ventis will enforce them.     
- **Distributed Futures**: Asynchronous execution without any user workflow modification.
- **Pluggable Policy Engine**: Supports multiple policies for orchestration, authorization and other serving policies.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ventis.git
cd ventis
pip install -e .
```
Note: Installation of ventis only needs to be done on the machine where you are running the deploy command. It does not need to be installed on the remote hosts where the agents are deployed. Ventis will automatically push code and environment to the remote hosts.

### 2. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Docker** — Used to manage agents.

## Development Guide 

#### Step 1: Create a Project
```bash
ventis new-project my-app
cd my-app
```
This command creates a new directory `my-app` with the following structure:
```
├── agents/               # Agent implementations and YAML definitions
│   ├── example_agent.py
│   └── example_agent.yaml
├── workflows/            # Workflow scripts (deployed as REST APIs)
│   └── example_workflow.py
├── config/
│   ├── global_controller.yaml   # Deployment configuration
│   └── policy.yaml              # Access control rules
├── stubs/                # Generated agent stubs (auto-generated)
├── grpc_stubs/           # Generated gRPC stubs (auto-generated)
└── README.md             # Readme for the project  
```
The Readme in the newly created project directory provides a quick overview of the project and how to use it. Including how to add new files etc. We provide some overview in next few steps.


#### Step 2: Define Your Agents
Place your agent logic (`.py`) and definitions (`.yaml`) in the `agents/` directory.

- **`agents/my_agent.yaml`**: Defines methods and schemas.
- **`agents/my_agent.py`**: Contains the actual Python implementation.

We have provided an example of a finance agent and a market research agent in the `examples/` directory. To run the example, copy files into your newly created project directory from within the your my-app directory with the command - 

```bash
cp -r ../examples/* ./
```

## Deployment Guide

#### Step 1: Configure the Global Controller
Edit `examples/config/global_controller.yaml` to list the agents you want to deploy, their hosts, ports, and resource limits.

#### Step 2: Build the project
```bash
ventis build
```
#### Step 2.1 (Only if performing distributed deployment):
If you are deploying agents and tools to multiple hosts, you need to make sure that the hosts are reachable from the machine where you are running the deploy command. To enable this please ensure that you have passwordless ssh access to the hosts. A guide to enable passwordless ssh access can be found [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/passwordless-ssh).


#### Step 3: Deploy the project
```bash
ventis deploy
```

#### Step 4: Sending requests to the workflow

Upon running the deploy command, ventis automatically generates a REST API endpoint for the workflow. 
Users can send requests to this endpoint to trigger the workflow. For this example, workflow to send a request - 

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/finance_workflow/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is the current stock price of Apple?"
  }'
```
The request is asynchronous. To get the result, you use the following URL-
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status/<request_id>
```

### Clean Generated Files

Remove all generated stub and gRPC files:

```bash
make clean
```

### Harnessing the power of Ventis
Beyond an easy programming model and end-to-end deployment. Ventis, enables developers to write custom policies to perform fine-grained control over their agents, workflows. 
Currently, we support two types of policies, with plans to add more in the future. 

* **Authorization Policies**: Define rules based on the fields in the request to restrict agent access. For example, `examples/config/policy.yaml` defines rules to restrict access to the `FinanceAgent` to only authorized callers like 'CEO' or 'Analyst'. A developer can specify rules based on the fields in the request to restrict agent access.


* **Load Balancing & Efficiency**: Ventis has built-in policies to perform load-balancing across multiple instances of the same agent. Request migrations ease head-of-line blocking, and our experiments show that Ventis's performance control can reduce tail latencies and enable efficient GPU utilization. Here is an example of the results.

## Future Work
- **Dynamic Policy Updates**: Currently, policies are loaded as static yaml files at startup. We are actively working on adding mechanisms to dynamically update policies based on custom user code. Allowing developer for more flexible and dynamic policy management.

- **Agent Thread Safety**: The Local Controller now executes agent methods in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This means multiple requests can run concurrently on the same agent instance. Currently, agents are assumed to be stateless or thread-safe. If an agent has mutable shared state, concurrent calls could cause data corruption. Future improvements could include per-thread agent instances, a locking mechanism, or a configurable concurrency mode (e.g., serial vs. parallel execution per agent).

- **Stale Future Detection**: If an agent process crashes mid-execution, a Future's result may never be available, causing indefinite waiting for the result.We currently  have a time-out based mechanism, in future we will add customizable retry policies.
